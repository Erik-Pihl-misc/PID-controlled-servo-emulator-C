# PID controlled servo emulator C
Emulator for PID controlled servo with two TOF sensors to read the relative angle, written in C.

The servo target angle is set to 90 degrees (center), with minimum and maximum angle set 
to 30 and 150 degrees (maximum angle 60 degrees to the left and right respectively). 
The minimum and maximum values of the TOF sensors are set to 0 and 1023 respectively. 

The servo is run continuously, where the used gets to enter values for left and right TOF sensor. 
The servo angle is then regulated to keep the servo heading towards the target. 
The target angle and current servo angle is printed in the terminal along with mapped input
value read from the sensors.
